============== > What is TypeScript ?

--------- > TypeScript is JavaScript with added syntax for types.TypeScripts added the static type in JavaScript.

JavaScript is loosely-typed-language.So JavaScript only check the type of any variable at the Run-Time OR 
we can say at the time of execution.

TypeScript has the ablity to check the type of variables at the time of compilation rather the runtime.
