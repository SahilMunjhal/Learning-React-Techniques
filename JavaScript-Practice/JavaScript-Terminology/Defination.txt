============== > What is TypeScript ?

--------- > TypeScript is JavaScript with added syntax for types.TypeScripts added the static type in JavaScript.

JavaScript is loosely-typed-language.So JavaScript only check the type of any variable at the Run-Time OR 
we can say at the time of execution.

TypeScript has the ablity to check the type of variables at the time of compilation rather the runtime.









================ > What is Error Boundary ?

-------- > Error Boundary are the React-Components that catches JavaScript errors in their child Component tree 
log those errors and display a fallback UI instead of the Component tree crashed.

Error boundaries do not catch errors for:

------- > Event handlers (learn more).
------- > Asynchronous code (e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks).
------- > Server side rendering.
------- > Errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children).

Error Boundary are the custom errors that are used to handle the JavaScript errors.In JavaScript errors we doesn't want
our whole app is crashed so in that case we can use the Error Boundary.


=============== > What is Memory Leakage in ReactJS ?

A memory leakage is a type of resource leaks that occurs when a resource is handled incorrecly.

A memory leakage happens when an object is stored  in memory but cannot be accesssed by the running code.

Memory leaks in React applications are primarily a result of not cancelling subscriptions made when a component
was mounted before the component gets unmounted. These subscriptions could be a DOM Event listener, a WebSocket
subscription, or even a request to an API.

Example -------- > On mounting of timer Component,We have started a timer in use-Effect by using a setInterval
But while unmounted the timer function,The set-Interval runs even after the Unmounting of timer Component.

2nd Example ------ > So,we have make a network request on the mounting of a component but while the data 
comes from the network request,we have already unmount the component.


============== > Difference between Link and NavLink ?

----------- > Links are known as HyperLinks.NavLink is used when someone wants to highLights the current
Link.It is used to style the active routes so that user knows on which page he or she is currently browsing
on the website.

NavLink is used with the activeClassName attribute.

<NavLink to="/home" activeClassName="active" >Home</NavLink><br/>
<NavLink to="/home" activeStyle={{color:"red"}} >Home</NavLink><br/>



===================== > What is the Difference between regular functions and arrow functions ?

-------- > Arrow functions do not have their own this.

let user = {
    name: "GFG",
    gfg1:() => {
        console.log("hello " + this.name); // no 'this' binding here
    },
    gfg2(){       
        console.log("Welcome to " + this.name); // 'this' binding works here
    }  
 };
user.gfg1();
user.gfg2();

(2). Arguments objects are not available in arrow functions, but are available in regular functions.

Example using regular ():-

let user = {      
    show(){
        console.log(arguments);
    }
};
user.show(1, 2, 3);


(3).  Since regular functions are constructible, they can be called using the ‘new’ keyword. However, the 
arrow functions are only ‘callable’ and not constructible. Thus, we will get a run-time error on trying to
construct a non-constructible arrow functions using the new keyword.

let x = function(){
    console.log(arguments);
};

new x =(1,2,3);


let x = ()=> {
    console.log(arguments);
};

new x(1,2,3);

Give Errors in this case.



===================== > Difference between Class and Functional Componennt ? 

--------- > There is no difference between class and functional components. Before the introduction of hooks 
functional components are stateless,we cannot manages the states.

(1.) A functional component is just a Plain JavaScript pure function that accepts props as an argument and 
returns a React element(JSX).

A class component requires we have to extend from React. Component and create a render function which returns a
React element.

(2) There is no render method used in functional components.

It must have the render() method returning JSX.

(3). Functional component run from top to bottom.

Class component has different life cycle method and invoked depending on phase of class component.

(4.) Class Components contain the features of Error Boundary while functional components doesnot contain 
this features.
